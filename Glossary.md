## GLOSSARY

### A

**Algorithm** - Refers to any set of rules or steps. _Technically_, a function is an algorithm, _but_, when we use the term algorithm with respect to software, we usually are referring to a set of steps that help us perform a data-intensive task, like sorting or organizing large sets of information.

**Argument** – The value(s) passed as the parameters of a function. Functions take _input_. The _variables_ we define as the _inputs_ for our functions are known as _parameters_. When we trigger a function in our code (which means passing in real values for our input), those values are referred to as _arguments_.

**Argus** – Second outermost planet in Star System A, The Nestomir.

### B

**Beautiful soup** – Earth-based Python library which provides tools for coders to webscrape (pull information off of webpages).

**Bernard Pinkett** - Creator of The Python programming language (The Nestomir).

**Binary (number system)** - A number system which uses only 0's and 1's to represent numerical values. Binary is referred to as a base 2 number system. The number system you're used to is (most likely) the base 10 number system, e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The fact we only need _two_ numerical values to represent _other_ numbers means we can use electronic circuitry to perform math very easily. This concept gave birth to modern computing.

**Boolean** - A boolean is a specific data type in Python (and in almost all programming languages). A boolean has two values, True or False.

**Bulk Cipher** – Secret, encoded language developed in the undergrounds of The Nestomir.

### C

**Caravine** - Area of Solar Forces fighter ships responsible for coordinating complex satellite communications.

**Cipher** - Coded language or information.

**Cipherium** - Hard-to-obtain Nestomirian software program which aids in the decoding of secret messages sent across the universe. Usually only accessible by The Solar Forces (and outlaws who access it illegally).

**Client** - In the world of computing and the internet, we refer to the device (or the specific program) in the end user’s hands as the _client_. For example, when using Instagram, the native app you download is the client. But there is much more to Instagram service beyond the client...e.g., there is a database, server, etc.

**Client-Server Architecture** - The internet was created with both clients and servers in mind. Clients enable users to easily consume information coming from over the internet. For client, think of the app on your phone showing you a news feed. When it comes to _servers_, we're referring to the actual computer sitting in a warehouse somewhere responding to all the requests coming from our clients. Servers enable clients to access information in an easily accessible way (because servers are centralized and congregate information in one place).

**Code** - General term to refer to the construction of a computer program through text-based characters.

**Code editor** - See text editor.

**Code Comment** – Coders use comments to document their software. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter (see interpreter) when our programs are run...but they allow us as coders to _take notes_ inside of our code. Why do we document our code? To remember why we wrote a specific segment of code in a certain way! Oftentimes, when we program, we forget what we've done after a few weeks or even a few years. It happens quite often. This is why commenting (documenting) our code is so important. It’s even more important when we’re working with others!

**Communications receiver** - Device installed in Nestomirian ships which enables them to communicate inter-galaxy.

**Comparison operator** - Comparison operators are used to compare two values. For example, the greater than sign > allows us to determine if one value is larger than another.

**Compiler** - A program which breaks down source code into machine code (0's and 1's). It’s the program that makes it possible for the computer to digest code and run it using the computer’s internal hardware (transistors).

**Control Flow** - Term used to describe how programming languages can make decisions based on the output of something else in the program. E.g., “if this is true, then do this, but if this is not true, then do something else”.

**Control-F** - We use control-f on our keyboard (control key + f key) to bring up the search bar. We use this search bar to find an element of text in the file or web page we are looking at.

**Cyprus A** - Smallest, and outermost planet in Star System A, The Nestomir galaxy. Tropical planet.

### D

**Dark Wars** - Galactic wars which took place between Naronia and the Venthum forces. The First Dark War took place in 4,000 Sentient Age. The Second Dark War took place 8,900 Sentient. Both wars resulted in catastrophic losses for both sides, including the destruction of planets. Both wars played a significant role in shaping the galaxy, galactic immigration, and Nestomirian political structures. More information will be uploaded from the archives soon.

**Data** - Generic term for information in digital form.

**Data Structure** - A data structure is a mechanism used to store data in a specific pattern. That pattern is optimized for the problem we want to solve. For example… do we want to look up information by name or via a list? Depending on the use case, we choose a specific data structure (or pattern) to store information. Lists and dictionaries are common data structures we use in Python.

**Data type** - A data type, in programming, classifies what “type” of information we store in a variable. For example, an integer? A boolean? Text? The most common data types we use are integers, booleans, and strings.

**Datetime** – Built-in Python library that allows coders to work with dates more easily.

**Decryption** - The process of unscrambling encrypted information.

**Delta 1 Death Cruiser** - Massive spacecraft carrier ships used by The Solar Forces.

**Dictionary** - A Python dictionary is a data structure that allows us to organize information with _keys_ that are associated to specific _values_. It is very similar to how a regular dictionary works. Words are the _keys_, and the _values_ are the associated definitions of the words. Dictionaries are incredibly powerful…many of the things we wish to organize, when we build almost anything, require us to look up things by a name.

**Documentation**- refers to the _commentary_ a coder generates to EXPLAIN how to USE the program they have created.

**Druinȉtis** - The Dark Continent of the planet Limora. See Limora.

### E

**Else-statement** - An _else-statement_ is a tool in programming which allows a block of code to run whenever its associated _if-statement_ expression evaluates to false. If this is true, do this, else, run this code, etc.

**Encoding** - Refers to modifying information to fit a specific format. It's important to note, encoding does not necessarily mean for security purposes. Encoding a piece of text can also be used to change the format of the text in a way that is less susceptible to errors (removing certain characters, etc.).

**Encryption** - The process of using mathematical principles to scramble information. This scrambled information can only be descrambled (decrypted) with a special key that only certain people have access to, similar to a password. The only difference is that this key actually plays a role in scrambling the information in the first place.

**Enlightened** - An _enlightened_ city refers to a city outside of The Nestomir Galaxy which contains Nestomirian residents (emigrants). The term _enlightened_ is used because each enlightened city contains a small population of native residents who are aware of the alien population; thus these natives are enlightened that they are not alone in the universe.

**Enlightened Registry** - List of cities across the Universe which contain a population alien to the native planet.

**Expression** - A piece of code that resolves to a singular value. E.g., 3 + 3.

### F

**Floating Point Number** - Another Python data type used to store and represent numbers that contain fractional values.

**Foresight** - Advanced power granted by The Utma. Only the greatest spiritual teachers and Solar Forces warriors are able to attain this power. It grants a sentient being the ability to predict certain movements before they happen. It is still not fully understood.

**FS Gravis** - Zimmer's freighter ship.

**Function** - A function is a set of instructions written with code. It is often used to repeat a commonly used set of instructions so they do not need to be written more than once. We define a function in Python using the _def_ keyword. To actually trigger a function, we use the function name, then two parentheses after the function name. e.g., add( ).

### G

**Gobhar** - Dendro's ancestral planet. Gobhar was destroyed during The First Dark War.

**Gobhrahim** - Those descending from the planet of Gobhar. See Gobhar.

**Grapefield, Wisconsin** - Jake's hometown. Located in central Wisconsin, a state in the USA.

**Guido van Rossum** - Known as the creator of Python on Earth…even though Python was created by Bernard Pinkett of The Nestomir.

### H

**Hash table** – A data structure which uses a special formula, called a _hash function,_ to compute the index (reference point in memory) of a key’s value based on the name of the key itself. Because the key (see key) name is directly related to the location in memory where the key’s value is stored – hash tables make information look up extremely fast. (This is a more advanced topic).

**Holy Curricula** - Curriculum defined by the great Naronian Spiritual Teachers. This curriculum was developed to coordinate learning with the attainment of powers from The Utma.

**HTTP** - HTTP is a protocol created by engineers to allow computers to send messages efficiently over the internet. (See protocol). This means every message sent over the internet needs to follow a very specific pattern (set of rules) to keep everything working smoothly.

**HTTP Body** - The HTTP body is where we store information inserted by the user _in_ an _HTTP request_. For example, if a user is filling out their profile on a website, when they click “save”, what's happening is that our _client_ (the website) is sending an _HTTP request_ to a _server_ telling the server to _save_ whatever text the user inputted as their profile description. The text the user inserted will get inserted in the http request BODY.

**HTTP content-type** - This is a standard HTTP header. (See HTTP Header). This header allows us to tell our server (when we make a request) what format we are sending our data in, or what format we wish to get back in the response.

**HTTP Get** - (See http request method). We use the GET request method when we are informing our server that our request relates to retrieving information it _already_ has access to...like an image or a file.

**HTTP Header** - HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional instructions with an HTTP request or response. It's a way to tune or adjust our request. For example, the _content-type_ header allows us to dictate what format we send the information a user has given us to send over the internet.

**HTTP message** - Refers to the entire HTTP request or response.

**HTTP Post** – A commonly used HTTP request method. (See http request method). We use the POST request method when we are informing our server that our request relates to _saving_ information.

**HTTP request method** - Every single HTTP request must contain a request METHOD. This is a specific instruction that tells our server how to think about the incoming request. For example, HTTP GET informs our server we are most likely asking for information the server already has. HTTP POST tells our server our request most likely wants it to save information so we can access it later. See HTTP GET and HTTP POST.

### I

**If-statement** - Statement that runs its code block only if its respective expression evaluates to true.

**Import statement** - An import statement in Python tells our program that the specific file we're working on needs access to a specific Python library. We need to do this when we use libraries (external code modules) in Python...and in most programming languages.

**Indo-One** – Lush, under explored continent on Cyprus-A.

**Initma** - Power granted by The Utma. Initma enables a Solar Forces warrior to calm down their mind in battle.

**Input** - This is the information we pass to a function. It is also referred to as a function's parameter(s). We also use the term input in the more generic sense to describe any information passed to something else, to derive a result.

**Internet** - The internet is a network of networks. It connects different webs of computers to one another. Through years of iteration and development, brilliant engineers and scientists have developed protocols to enable different networks of computers to interact with each other.

**Interpreter** - An interpreter is a computer program which executes source code (like Python) in steps. This is in comparison to a compiler (see compiler), which is a program which breaks down all of your source code into machine code (0's and 1's) after the coder is done working on the file. Interpreters allow coders to more easily run their programs (the coder does not need to wait for the entire program to be compiled down to machine language before they run their code). However, compiled programs can often be faster when they are run. There is a tradeoff. There are deeper explanations of compiler vs. interpreter, which relate to the type of information each program outputs to our computer – but this is well beyond the scope of Part I.

**Interstellar Booster** - Enables a ship to enter and leave quantum space. Critical to interstellar space travel. These devices are expensive, and not accessible to the common person.

**IP address** - An IP address is a unique numerical address for your computer on the internet. Similar to a street address.

### J

**Jasmine Tea** - Popular beverage in The Nestomir galaxy. Brings both great focus and calm to its drinkers.

**Jenfogē** - Solar Forces game developed by its soldiers. Involves grenades and putting.

**Jupyter Notebook** - Program, runnable in the browser, that allows coders to create a notebook using Python. It provides a really, really awesome way for coders to integrate code into their research and technical projects.

### K

**Kahve** - Coffee-like drink native to The Nestomir.

**Key** - Python dictionaries are made up of keys and values. A key is the name we look up to find the associated information to the key name. For example, in a real dictionary, the keys are the word names, and the values are the definitions.

**Knight of Dieu Khien** - Guardians of The Vostluka bloodline. Usually always by their master’s side.

### L

**La'Tishvah** - One of the holiest concepts in Naronian culture. La'Tishvah quite literally means “To Learn With Purpose” in the native Naronian tongue.

**LAN** - Local area network. This is a network that brings together computers within a limited area such as a school, office, or university campus.

**Ld'Shab** - Core religion adopted by Naronian Culture. It is a religion centered around learning.

**Library** - Term used to describe a bundled module of code that can be downloaded or used in a variety of projects to serve a specific purpose. Important to note that a library, in the case of Python, or any other language, is PURE code (Python).

**Limora** - Mysterious, crime-filled planet. Limora has a special continent on it called, Druinȉtis, a.k.a., The Dark Continent.

**List** - A list in python is a built-in data type in Python. Lists allow us to store multiple items in a single variable in a specific order. Under the hood, lists rely on data structures - which store lists in memory in as efficient of a way as possible.

**Lithium Radar** - Communication device installed in the left arm of Solar Forces special operation fighters.

### M

**Markdown** - A syntax used by programmers to format written text. Different inline symbols generate different formatting, like bold, italic, etc.

**Math** - Built-in Python library that you can use to perform mathematical tasks.

**Matplotlib** - Open source, earth-based, Python library which allows us to nicely graph and plot data.

**Memory** - Memory is where the computer stores (temporary) information in a program. Think of it as the short-term memory in your brain. It's not where you store long term information, but more where you store the grocery list you know you have to get at the supermarket later. Memory is actual hardware, which using circuitry, can store information temporarily. We often refer to computer memory as RAM (random access memory).

**Modules** – A Python module is similar to a library, but it’s important to understand the differences between the two. A module is the actual Python-wise definition on how to bundle a segment of code that is importable. You can think of a library as the more generic sense of a sharable bundle of code. A module is the technical definition of something that can be imported into your code. A lot of this relates to syntax and set up of the code you want to share (your library).

**Moon City** - Capital city of The Republic of Naronia.

### N

**Naronia** - Capital planet of The Nestomir galaxy and Star System A. Home of The Naronian Republic and The Solar Forces. It is located three million light years from Earth.

**Nilofar System, Eta Omega** - Naronia's name for The Milky Way.

### O

**Operating System –** You can think of a computer’s operating system as the program of all programs working inside of a computer. The operating system also has an intimate relationship with our computer’s hardware. It’s coordinating all of the inputted and outputted information from each individual program and ensuring it gets to the right place at the right time.

**Output** - Functions take inputs (parameters) and RETURN output. For example, a function called _add_, could take in two numbers as input, and return the _sum_ as an output.

### P

**Parameter** - Another term for INPUT (with respect to a function). For example, if we have a function named _add_ that adds two numbers together, let's say, a, and b, a and b are what we refer to as the _parameters_ of the function.

**Payload** - In the context of the lesson in this book, a payload is the _user inserted data_ that we embed in the body of our _http post request_. It's kind of like the “cargo” that we are transporting in our message.

**PIP** - pip is a package-management program in Python used to install and manage software packages (libraries). It taps into an online collection of public (open source) packages, called the Python Package Index. It allows us to download libraries into our Python based projects extremely easily.

**Print** - Print is a built-in Python function. We use it anywhere in our code to display the result of a specific value in our program to OUR TERMINAL. Print is essential because when a program runs, we can't actually SEE anything happening UNLESS we display the results of certain steps of our program to our screen (terminal). You will get NOWHERE as a coder without learning how to use print. Even senior engineers use PRINT ALL OVER THEIR PROGRAMS. It helps us catch mistakes EARLY. As humans, we're prone to making careless errors, as well as legitimate errors. This is fine, we just need a way of easily isolating these issues which is what PRINT enables us to do (most of the time)! In other words print() is a coder’s BEST FRIEND!!

**Protocol** - A protocol is a set of rules that everyone, or everything, in the same system can (or must) obey. It allows things to stay in sync. Without a protocol, it makes it extremely hard for machines (or even humans) to communicate with each other.

**Pseudo-coding** - Pseudo-coding is the process of using written language (e.g., English) to map out the steps of your program BEFORE you write real code. It's like outlining your essay before you write it, and it often saves you a ton of time! But we often don’t do it because we don’t feel like it!

**PyGame** - PyGame is an open source Python library (earth-based) that enables coders to build games.

**PyPI** - The official third party open source software library repository for Python. PIP connects to PyPI.

**Python** - General purpose coding language developed in The Nestomir galaxy.

### Q

**Quantum Space** - A series of micro dimensions where only information exists. Used for interstellar travel.

**Quantum Starmap** - A map used for ship navigation through quantum space. Partially leverages the massive energy-mass of stars to hone in on interstellar destinations.

### R

**Radium** - Radioactive element present on both Earth and Nestomirian planets.

**Real Space** - The dimensions where standard life (and reality) exist. As opposed to quantum space, where only information exists.

**Republic of Naronia** - Principal ruling republic of the planet of Naronia. Power is separated between The Solar Senate and The Naronian Council.

**Reusability** - Reusability is a critical concept in all of programming, and engineering in general (and probably life also :)). But in the domain of coding, it refers to creating and organizing programs in such a way where the same instructions never have to be repeated. This is one of the primary skills of experienced coders, and something often hard to really “get” as a beginner.

**Return statement** - A return statement is essential to building useful programs. We use return statements to DELIVER THE OUTPUT of our functions. For a function to actually spit out or return output based on the instructions, we must RETURN. We often forget to do this when we first learn to code. (We expect the function to do it automatically, but functions need to be explicitly told to return something!)

**Riemann Hypothesis** – Important mathematical hypothesis first proposed by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann.

**Ring of Vernost** - Ruling political circle in the government of Venthe.

**Router**- A router is a piece of networking equipment that forwards data between computer networks. Routers perform the data directing functions on the Internet. They are very similar to a traffic cop directing traffic to the necessary lanes. Without them, information has no idea where to go.

### S

**SciPy** – Python library which provides coders access to all sorts of mathematical and engineering tools.

**Sentauri Beacon I** - The model of Dendro's Solar Forces fighter ship. These were more expensive than their successors, The Star Beacon VII’s.

**Server** - A server is a computer that sits on the internet listening for incoming _requests_. It awaits requests from clients (people like you and me, aliens, and other computers). When a server receives a request, it puts together a _response_, usually by first talking to a database which houses important information. The server then responds with the right information in the right format to the client. See _client_.

**Skruzden Warriors** - Multiple races fight in the Venthum Space Legions, just as multiple races fight for The Republic of Naronia (in the Solar Forces). The Skruzden are an ancient race, native to the planet of Venthe. They are a species governed and controlled by The Ring of Vernost, the ruling political body on Venthe. They are also the only other race indigenous to Venthe, besides the Native Venthum.

**Software** - Refers to the code-based instructions that tell a computer how to work.

**Spectator One** - Solar Forces protocol which states that a witness of a war-related event, who is non-military, must be taken under the protection of The Solar Forces until a Solar Forces general decides on next steps.

**Star System A** - The binary star system located inside The Nestomir galaxy that houses the planet of Naronia and (most of) the planets in this story.

**Statement** - An _expression_ produces or resolves to a single value. A STATEMENT is simply an instruction in a computer program that does not resolve to a specific value…like assigning a value to a variable. Programs are made up of nothing beyond expressions and statements. They are the building blocks of code.

**String** - In computing, when concerning data types, a string is a specific sequence of characters. For example the name “Jason” is a string, with 5 characters running in a specific order. We use quotes, single, or double, in Python, to generate strings. “Jason”, “Cat”, “Ra32ndomsStrIng”

**Sub Forces Doctrine** - Ld'Shab religious lore concerning how The Utma can be broken down into distinguished sub-forces.

### T

**Tarvezius** – Second innermost planet in Star System A, The Nestomir. Zena's home planet.

**TensorFlow** - Artificial intelligence (earth-based) library created by Google.

**Teqwequar Nebula** - The nebula the Ld'Shab religion believes to be the singularity point of creation.

**Terminal** - The terminal (often interchangeable in modern times with “computer console”) is an important tool in a coder’s rolodex. The terminal is a way for beings to talk a little more intimately with our computer's operating system. When we run a Python program, that program is interfacing with our computer's operating system. When we use a command like print(), for example, we are telling the computer's operating system to display a value it is housing in memory to our screen. Most code editors give us quick access to our computer's terminal...it's a small sub window with a blinking cursor. We also use the terminal to actually run our programs and to talk to _other_ programs in our computer.

**Text Editor** - A text editor is essentially a word processing program that allows us to more easily write and organize our code. It's ESSENTIAL to remember that code is JUST TEXT. You could write code in a Microsoft word file if you wanted to, but code editors do special things for us like highlight and format code so it's much easier to read.

**The Accelerated Parry** - Power granted by The Utma which allows a Solar Forces fighter to dodge (and sometimes deflect) a blow with a hyper fast, blur like movement.

**The Affagi** - The ruling Mentosi family, The Affagi, sit at the forefront of Naronian politics. The Affagi have been the primary leaders in all of the Naronian government for over twenty-five hundred years.

**The Benefit Teachings** - The specific teachings of The Holy Curricula, as adapted by The Solar Forces.

**The First Temple** - The First Ld'Shab temple created by The Nestomir’s original Spiritual Teachers.

**The Holy Reusable Root** - Ld'Shab spiritual term used to refer to The Function (see The Function).

**The Larhadian Asteroid Belt** - Asteroid belt located in between Venthe, Tarvezius, and Naronia.

**The Mentosi** - The Mentosi are an ancient Naronian race. They are the only species of high-intelligence native to Naronia. The ruling Mentosi family, The Affagi, sit at the forefront of Naronian politics. The Affagi have been the primary leaders in all of the Naronian government for over twenty-five hundred years.

**The Nestomir** - Spiroid galaxy located approximately 3 million light years from The Milky Way.

**The New Doctrine** - Political document created by The Vostluka line (leading family on Venthe). The document professes that only specific citizens should be educated. It also professes that these selected citizens should not be offered a diverse range of knowledge–only knowledge pertaining to highly specific skills. The document led to the _misting_ of Venthe; this involved filling the Venthe atmosphere with a chemistry that removes a certain form of ambition from its citizens.

**The Philosophical Tenets of the Ld'Shab** - Critical book in the Ld'Shab religion.

**The Solar Forces** - The military arm of The Republic of Naronia. Sworn to protect the republic and its constituents, as well as maintain order in The Nestomir Galaxy.

**The Spiritual Planes** - Ld'Shab religious lore concerning dimensions of the spirit.

**The Utma** - Force believed to drive how all sentient beings love, learn and create. It is worshipped by most of the beings of Naronia, and in the Naronian Republic. The religion of Ld'Shab is centered around the worship of The Utma. The Utma to this day is not perfectly understood, but it is believed to permeate all of the known universe. It is sometimes referred to as The Learning Force.

**Transistor** - The transistor is one of the electrical inventions that led to the birth of modern computing. A transistor is essentially an electrical switch, which uses a small electrical current to determine if another, much larger, electrical current can flow out of its gates. A transistor represents a 0 or a 1 in the hardware of computers. Current on, current of, 1, 0, etc.

**Turtle** – Earth-based open source Python art library.

### U

**Unix** - Unix is an early earth-based operating system that has impacted how most modern computing systems are structured today. Initially created in Bell Labs in the 1970's, many of its core features, such as multitasking, and permitting multi-user usership, have trickled into nearly all the digital devices we know and love, including video game systems. It is a “grandparent” of modern operating systems, if you will.

**URL** – Short for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is an address to a highly specific resource accessible on the web (an image, a file, etc.).

**Utma Benefits** - Superpowers granted by The Utma.

### V

**Value** - In the lesson context, it refers to the value associated to a specific _key_ in a _dictionary_.

**Variable** - A variable in Python is a dedicated place in computer memory to store values. Think of it like a safe. There is the safe _and_ what you store in the safe. The variable is the safe itself, and the items in the safe is the data stored in the variable. The information stored in a variable can change (most of the time), that is why we refer to them as variables.

**Venthe** - Innermost planet in Star System A, also known as The Cracked Planet. Home of the Venthum Forces and The Vostluka Bloodline – sworn enemies of The Naronian Republic.

**Venthum Space Legions** - Military force of The Venthum regime

**Venthum** – This is a general term referring to races and species descending from the planet of Venthe. Often used to refer to the Venthum government. It is important to note that the people of Venthe, though not well understood, are essentially held captive by ruling powers there.

### W

**Weapon's harnessing** - See Zegmu.

### Z

**Zegmu** - A superpower granted by The Utma force which enables a solar forces soldier to use a _dusted_ weapon. It also enables a fighter to levitate their weapon in mid-air. _Dusted_ refers to stardust from the Teqwequar nebula, believed to be the center of creation.
