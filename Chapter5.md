## CHAPTER 5

#### WHAT’S THAT YOU SAY, A FORCE?

Jake’s vision came into focus an undetermined amount of time later. His head felt a bit clearer. Sleep had its ways of medicating the mind.

His nap had instilled some positivity in him, and a new thought popped into his head. Maybe he could devise a plan to extricate himself from Dendro’s control and return to his family. He tightened up the strings on his hoodie so the fabric stretched tighter around his head. The low hum of the ship’s engines was still audible. He looked at the futuristic Kahve maker bubbling on the countertop, and then at the retina scanner next to Dendro’s dormitory door.

He walked back down the short hallway into the cockpit. Dendro was huddled over some papers. He picked up his head every few moments to tinker with the display in front of him. “How long was I out?” Jake asked, a hint of sleepiness still in his voice.

“About an Earth hour,” he responded.

Jake sat down and strapped on the seat belt.

“How did you end up in the military?” Jake asked.

“Who, me?” Dendro grunted, still focused on the papers in front of him. “Watched too many war movies. I grew up in The Lower Palisades, a rough neighborhood in Moon City, the capital city of Naronia. Not much opportunity for work or anything good, especially as a Tier II race. Walked into the recruiter’s office one day. Guess that was it.”

“Did your parents encourage you to join?” Jake asked.

“Not really,” he snorted. “My father died when I was young. My mother has always been supportive of my desire to protect the Naronian motherland, but she did not support my desire to go into Special Operations, which is the most lethal but also the most thrilling part of the Solar Forces military arm.”

“Do you speak with your mother often?” Jake asked.

“When I can...every three to four months up here. It’s not easy with the communication restrictions,” Dendro said in his gravelly voice.

“I see,” Jake said.

As the ship soared over the North American continent, Jake considered the existence of Dendro's alien world, Naronia, with its different races living together. It made him think of the fantasy books Mrs. Krezia read to his class in elementary school. How could any of this be real? His mind raced as he considered the possibilities of an alien planet. What did the different species on Dendro’s planet look like? He wondered about the Naronian government, and what it would be like to travel through space at light speed.

Dendro tapped on a green button positioned on the top left center of the ship's joystick. Immediately, underneath the console in front of Dendro, a keyboard popped out and a text editor program appeared on the display. Dendro began using the keyboard arrows to tinker with something on the screen.

“What is that?” Jake asked.

“It’s software, code. Python. I’m updating some flight settings on the ship. Our aileron seems clunky.” Dendro stared intently at the screen as he typed.

“Python? Like what the hackers use on Earth?” Jake asked, baffled.

Dendro turned and looked at him intently. “Code is _all_ that we are. This is _all_ that I am. I am a Solar Forces fighter, and my loyalty is to the Ld’Shab, to the Utma.” Dendro’s yellow eyes looked at Jake intensely, then he grinned.

“Python is all that you are? Ld’Shab? What?” Jake asked, not sure if Dendro was messing with him. But something told Jake that Dendro didn’t seem like the kind of guy to make jokes in tense moments.

Dendro cupped the silver medallion hanging from his neck and stroked it gently. “Our culture practices an ancient philosophy, known as Ld’Shab, which comes from our appreciation, study, and worship of the Learning Force, _the Utma_,” Dendro answered.

Jake frowned in confusion.

Dendro minimized a window sitting above the lower part of the application screen. “The Ld’Shab religion, a religion based on learning itself, guides all life in the Naronian republic. The Utma Force has been studied by Naronian society since the inception of our civilization. Our religion, _the Ld'Shab_, is based on the critical dogma that _the Utma_ was brought into existence by _Our Creator_ to guide our learning process for the purpose of bettering our world.”

Jake scratched his head.

Dendro lifted his hands off the keys and turned to Jake. “We believe that an intelligent being's purpose is to learn. Learning is our goal, as both individuals and as a species. To say it more authentically, the Ld’Shab religion believes that life’s purpose is to _learn with purpose_. In our native tongue, the term for _learning with purpose_, is known as _La’Tishvah.”_

Jake's eyes bulged. Thinking of a new galaxy was hard enough to process, but the wonder and freakishness of an entirely different philosophy and religion made his head spin. “The religion on your planet is based on learning itself? But what does that have to do with Python?”

“Python is one of the most critical skills to absorb in the eyes of The Utma,” Dendro said. “The Learning Force, the Utma, incentivizes us to learn specific subjects it feels will better our society—mostly in subjects like computing, networking, and other fields of engineering. There are many other subjects we believe it wants to promote but we do not yet fully understand The Utma’s directions regarding those topics. About five hundred years ago our spiritual teachers discovered the precursors to what we refer to as _physically tangible_ Utma Benefits. These are benefits that sentient beings are awarded when studying critical components of the Utma.”

“What does that mean?” Jake asked, perplexed.

“It means as we study a certain holy Ld'Shab Curriculum—_The Holy Curricula_, under certain conditions which our spiritual teachers have honed over hundreds of years, we are granted metaphysical powers. Powers beyond the explanation of the physical world. Powers granted by the Utma itself.

Jake's eyes lit up. “You receive metaphysical benefits, like special powers, for studying something?” His face scringed with skepticism. “How is that even possible? It's like magic?”

“That, my friend, is not an easy question to answer. And no, we do not call it magic. It is the _way_ of the Universe. Our teachers believe that the Utma does not want us to turn a blind eye to something so essential to the creativity of intelligent beings. Although computers drive _both_ of our worlds, most beings inside of our worlds walk around with no idea understanding as to how they function. The Utma wants us to pay closer attention.”

Jake pondered for a moment. “What powers are you granted?”

Dendro turned to face Jake. “Powers that enhance our capabilities to fight and defend ourselves against our foes. You must recognize that the Special Operative soldiers of the Solar Forces, and our most prominent spiritual teachers, are the only members of society to date to formally train to obtain these powers. From how we wield our Solar Forces weapons to maneuvering our shields to enhancing balance to speeding up how we move–all the way to augmenting how we control and master our most important weapon–our minds, we gain new powers as we learn from the _Holy Curricula_.”

Dendro picked up his axe from its holder on the wall. He put it near his chest. As he let go, it did not drop, but floated in midair beside him. The shining golden edges glimmered in the cockpit light.

“Whoa,” Jake blurted aloud. “How the—.” He stopped speaking as Dendro flicked his levitating axe, causing it to rotate in place.

“This power is called _Weapons Harnessing_. It lets us wield a Solar Forces weapon. It is one of many superpowers we are granted for being students of _The Holy Curricula._”

Jake stared in awe at the floating golden weapon. _What kept it in the air?_

Dendro placed it back on the holding compartment on the ship wall.

“This is too much for me to handle,” Jake said. He looked back at the axe a moment later. A chill ran up his spine. There were too many questions formulating in his head.

“So, your soldiers, the special operatives…they are the only ones who train to gain these powers?” Jake asked.

“Affirmative. Our training. Our focus. Our development. It all revolves around studying the _Core Understandings_ derived from _The Holy Curricula_.” Dendro stroked the silver orb hanging from his neck.

“But Python you said?” Jake looked at the screen. “How can you learn something so complicated?” Jake asked.

“Well, for one, Naronian society does a much better job at teaching in general—The Solar Forces, our schools, all parts of society—all have a unique take on learning. We appreciate nature and the tools she’s given us. We do not fear technical complexity; we learn to appreciate intricate things, not fear them. But it starts for us with our spiritual teachers. They train our military personnel, and so bits and pieces of their wisdom slip into our hands. This wisdom, and these critical lessons, are taught to us in training. There is _no choice_ but to learn. And as each leader imparts their knowledge, we grow closer to the Utma. And the meaning, purpose, and understanding of _The Holy Curricula_ make more sense to us.”

Dendro massaged his elbow for a moment as if it bothered him. “Growing up in the Lower Palisades, an impoverished neighborhood of Naronia, I had nothing but fighting, girls, and sports on my mind. I didn't think I could amount to anything. But once I was introduced to our _Holy Curricula_ in training—and to code, I was forever changed.”

“But I don’t even understand what code is. Where does code _even go_? Like _where_ do you put it? I get it helps us give instructions to a computer, but where does it end up, and what can we do with it?” Jake asked.

Outside the ship, lightning flashed. Thunder cracked around them, causing the ship to rock.

“Code is language. No different than the letters and punctuation that make up your native tongue, which you call English. You use English to communicate with others, and code is a way for us to communicate with computers,” Dendro said. “However, the truth is, as our great spiritual teachers have taught us throughout modern Nestomirian history, it is a bit deeper than that. A computer processes information in zeros and ones. Ons and offs, per se. That's how its circuitry operates. So, we are not exactly communicating with the computer, but providing it with instructions that can be translated down into a language the computer can understand.”

“What do you mean by _that’s how its circuitry operates_?” Jake raised an eyebrow in confusion.

“A computer uses a special component called a transistor, which is a tiny electrical on and off switch, to do everything it needs to do. From playing video games to crunching numbers, at the end of the day it's just an arrangement—a very complex arrangement of these electrical switches firing together that makes a computer tick. At the lowest levels of the computer, at the transistor level, the computer only understands these ONs and OFFs. We use a number system called _binary_ to describe this language of ON and OFF. It consists of only two digits: zeroes and ones, or ON’S and OFF’S,” Dendro said. “You can think of it as a certain type of morse code–a simple pattern, but by using math, we can represent and process almost any type of information we want quite efficiently.”

“Okay, I think I get it. So, code is just a way to...translate what we want the computer to do, into these zeroes and ones...these ONs and OFFs?” Jake asked.

“Precisely. We _could_ speak to the computer in zeroes and ones, but it would take years to write the most basic instructions. That’s why we need an intermediary. We can imagine code as a space between the computer and the being, a place where we are able to coexist. This is the space where we write our programs with what we call code and it is the primary reason why scientists and engineers in The Nestomir invented coding languages,” Dendro said.

Jake scratched his forehead for a moment. “So, Python is that intermediary?”

“Yes. The language of choice for many applications in the Forces is Python, which you see here on my ship's screen,” Dendro said. “It was invented by Bernard Pinkett in 13,997 Sentient. The Earthling, Guido van Rossum, who gets credit on your planet for inventing the language, actually stumbled upon Python during a Naronian government experiment. The language’s designs were left on his desk by a Naronian agent in an attempt to study how Python would proliferate out of the galaxy. Guido took credit for its creation,” Dendro stated.

“Are you serious?” Jake asked, wide eyed.

“I would not joke around about something like that,” Dendro responded.

“Do you mean to tell me your society knows of Earth and has interacted with Earth before?” Jake asked, baffled. “I thought I heard you mention something about that before.”

“Oh, yes. We ventured out of the galaxy some five hundred years ago.”

“That is both terrifying and incredible, I guess. But one thing I don't understand. How, if a computer only understands zeros and ones, can it process this code, this Python, which is made up of _text_?”

“To put it simply, there is a translation process. Another program can break down our text statements, digest them, and convert them into zeros and ones. We sometimes refer to this program as a compiler, or an interpreter. We can spend a lot of time studying the innards of these translation tools, and the hardware itself. It is important to note that coding is still only a subset of understanding the computer…a lot more goes into Computer Science.”

Jake’s eyes flashed. “That is _wild_. The computer can use its own insides to digest our human statements?” Jake said, thinking out loud. He pondered for a few moments thinking about the implications of what Dendro was saying. “But still, what can we actually _do_ with code? What are these hackers I see on TV and in the movies actually doing?” Jake said.

“A coder's responsibility, first and foremost, is to _move information around as efficiently as possible_. And ironically, that often means, _using as little code as possible to achieve a task_. Great coders hate extra fat,” Dendro said.

“Hmm, that actually makes sense to me. It's like my English teacher told us, less is more,” Jake blurted out.

“Yes. What coders are often doing is examining where information is coming from, and then figuring out the most efficient way to get it where it needs to go. It's about the _data_, the _information_, that a programmer cares most about, _and it just so happens_ that code is the only tool we have at our disposal to move information from one place to another.”

“Jeez. So, we focus on moving information around first, not writing the code?” Jake asked, as he wrinkled his nose.

“Yes. It's about the problem-solving thought process of organizing and moving information around and getting it to where it needs to go. A great programmer thinks about how the information moves around first, and then writes the code to move it.”

Dendro cleared his throat with a grunt. “The syntax, the brackets, semi-colons, indents, ‘they don’t mean nothin’, Professor Alvarez used to tell us in basic training. What matters is how you break down the problem you are trying to solve,” Dendro said.

“Interesting. I think I get that. But I still don't fully get why we really use code in the first place for computer games and apps?” Jake asked.

“We can use code to build a web server to power your new social network, to implement a pattern in your next piece of digital art, or to control your homemade music synthesizer. We can use code to create a new arcade video game. We can use it to write a program to organize accounting for a new business, or to write the next algorithm that predicts the price of a cryptocurrency—yes, that is popular in The Nestomir as well.” Dendro clicked around on his screen. “We can use code to generate software that can aid in our ability to understand and cure deadly diseases. At the end of the day, we have to appreciate that sentient beings and computers are a powerful combination. That’s why we need to learn to communicate with computers in the first place.”

“So you think it’s essential to learn code?” Jake asked, tugging on his earlobe.

“Not exactly. The world, or I should say, our Universe, will continue to be revolutionized by code. But it doesn’t mean we all have to become coders. It means we should appreciate the power code gives us, with respect to any industry or passion. We can reinvent art, enhance our ability to make music, help our businesses analyze data, and solve a variety of cross-functional problems in an unprecedented manner. All fields, medicine, art, science, sports, gaming, can benefit. Understanding it _is_ critical. However, becoming a coder is a choice.”

Dendro scrolled down the page on his screen. “Here I am using a very important programming concept, called _a variable_. A variable stores information in our computer’s memory so we can retrieve it later. Here I am using a variable to store the sensitivity value of our aileron, the flap-like things on the wing that help us tilt the ship. This sensitivity controls how sharp our turns will feel, especially in a storm.”

Dendro tapped some keys on his glowing keyboard. “In Python, to declare a new variable, we simply write the name of the variable and use an `=` sign to assign a variable's value. See here, I’m updating our aileron’s sensitivity value in our Python program.”

Dendro zoomed in on his screen and shifted the monitor towards Jake.

“So, we have _named_ this variable _sensitivity_, and we have set its _value_ to 0.78. Python is very flexible in terms of the types of information we can store in a variable. Here we’re storing a decimal. In Python we refer to this type of data as a _floating point_ number. We could use a variable to store a string, which is an arrangement of characters, like the name “Jake” or “Dendro.” We can also use a variable to store another data type, called a _boolean_. This is a data type that is meant to represent if something is true, or false. A boolean variable will store either a _True_ or _False_ value. Booleans come in handy in coding, as the most complex of problems often can be simplified down to a variety of true and false statements. For example, there are many times our programs may want to do something like…if this is _true_, then perform this action, or if this is _false_, then perform this other action. There are other data types we can discuss later on,” Dendro said.

Dendro pointed at the screen. “I'm telling the computer: _Open a memory slot for me called “sensitivity” and store the decimal 0.78 inside of it_,” he said. “The variable is _sensitivity,_ the value stored inside the variable is 0.78. Variables allow us to store important information quickly, so we can access it later. If you understand that concept, you’re already making headway into understanding code.”

“That’s cool,” Jake said.

“Here, take this.” Dendro reached underneath his seat and came up holding a silver chain. It looked like the one he was wearing, just shorter. He placed it on Jake’s neck.

“What is this?” Jake asked as he felt the cold metal against his skin.

“It is a very special object from our galaxy. An orb containing stardust from the _Teqwequar Nebula_, the nebula our religion believes to be the singularity point of creation. An object that we control through the Utma, like my axe, must contain this stardust. The _dusted orb_, as we sometimes call it, enables you to _register Utma feedback_. If you gain a _Core Understanding_, the Utma can now _reward_ you.

“How?” Jake asked, curling his eyebrows

“You shall see,” Dendro responded.

The cockpit let out a few high-pitched beeps.

Dendro looked at the monitor mounted over his head. “We must prepare for landing. Make sure you’re buckled in. We will be in the Salt Lake City airspace in the next forty-five minutes. Once on the ground, Lithium Radar should be able to tap into local WAN and local WIFI, letting us to pull up detailed floor and security plans of the lab facility.”

“So, this should be a simple in and out?” Jake asked innocently.

“It should be. I won’t know for sure until we’re on the ground–there could be some rough patches, but let’s hope for the best. Hold tight,” Dendro said.
