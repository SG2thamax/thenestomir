**For Example**

> "I once spent 8 hours debugging a file that had nothing wrong with it. I was in such a rush, my brain completely missed I was executing the wrong file name on the command line. The moral of the story: always practice patience when learning a new topic. Your mind will relax and the small details you would ordinarily miss will be absorbed by your brain faster (ultimately speeding up your ability to learn a new topic successfully)." – Steven Reubenstone, New York
