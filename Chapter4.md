## CHAPTER 4

#### INTO THE WISCONSIN SKY

The creature stared directly at Jake, its yellowish silver eyes blinking every few moments.

_It looks like a cut demon_, Jake thought, as his body began to vibrate. His body told him to run, so that’s exactly what he did. He turned around and sprinted, but he immediately tripped on a thick piece of rubble, falling hard on his right arm. He rolled over onto his rear and pushed himself back up. As the dirt fell off him, he noticed his forearm was bleeding.

As the creature stepped forward, he could more clearly make out its uplifted nose, strong angled jaw, and intricately formed pointed ears. Jake felt a sensation of paralysis come over him. _Body, work please._ The thing appeared to have a small bun of hair perfectly arranged on top of its head. _How can it be that perfect after being in that hole?_ A round silver orb, on a long silver chain, hung from its neck. And the eyes. The glowing yellow eyes seemed to cut straight through Jake.

He backpedaled slowly.

The creature put its hand up again.

“What is your name?” the creature asked in a gravelly voice. It wiped the dirt off its legs and dark boots. A thick belt wound around its body with all sorts of mysterious things hanging from it: something that looked like a pair of grenades, a dagger, and most noticeably, a treacherous golden axe.

_Jake_ shivered violently. _I’m tripping._

“It is easier to speak if I know your name,” the creature said tonelessly.

“My my name is J-J-J-Jake,” he said.

“How did you get to me here?” it asked.

“I was...I was following a scent...I fell asleep...I walked through the…the alley,” Jake responded as his body continued to quiver.

The creature turned and pointed. “I was unconscious in that hole for almost twenty-four local hours. I do not understand how I got here.” It looked up towards the sky. There was a badge with a golden threaded emblem on the creature’s silver left shoulder plate.

There was no doubt he was being spoken to by something that was not human. It couldn’t be. The creature turned over its left arm, exposing a glowing light green screen that appeared to be built into its flesh and spoke: “Comms. Crash confirmed. Whereabouts unknown. Vital signs are strong. What is our status? Requesting information and aid.”

_It has a phone in its arm?_

The creature waited for a response, but there was no answer. It repeated the message again into the screen. Nothing.

It tilted its head towards the night sky, then towards his smoking ship, and then back to Jake.

_How could this creature speak English?_ Jake thought.

“You mean to tell me you just stumbled into this field?” the being said.

“Yes, yes. Well, no. I smelled smoke, I was heading home,” Jake said as his teeth chattered. “What…what the heck are you, dude?”

“What am I? I am a Gobhrahim from Naronia.” The creature wiped some dirt from its eyelids.

“What? A what?” Jake asked. He thought about running again.

The creature did not respond at first; instead, it gazed upward. Then it appeared to swipe through something on the screen built into its arm. A few moments later, it tapped something in frustration, as if the display were not working.

“Our Delta One Death Cruiser. It was hit. Our captain. He lost control. We went into full electrostatic tumble. It was an ambush. How could we not see it? The Larhadian Asteroid Belt. Venthum forces. Three million light years away? They went full stealth. We’ve never seen it happen in nearly ten millennia,” the creature said as it peered up at the sky again. “How can this be? How can I possibly be here?”

“You come from space?” Jake asked tremulously.

“We all come from space. But yes, I am from a galaxy foreign _to you,_ known as The Nestomir. It is a spiroid galaxy a few million light years away from here, apparently,” the creature responded in its rough voice.

“The Nestomir?” Jake repeated.

“We lost our right wing,” the creature blurted out, in an aggravated tone. “I have no booster. I could not have gotten here alone.”

Jake began to feel extremely dizzy.

“I don't know what this is or where I am. I think I'm sick. I need my mother. Mom! Diana! I am hallucinating! I need that depression medicine Aunt Holly takes! I have been playing too many video games. Never again. I swear!” Jake cried. He closed his eyes waiting for something, or someone to wake him up from this obvious dream.

He opened his eyes again, but he was still in the pit.

The creature peered at him. “I must get back to base. The Venthum are cunning. They will be sweeping all the known systems by now, even if they have limited resources in these regions. How did I get here? No response from ground comms. Something's very wrong.” The creature’s eyes flickered. “My Lithium Radar does not make mistakes.” It flipped over its left forearm again. The screen appeared to display some sort of starmap. “It confirms I am in the Nilofar System, Eta Omega, in the local tongue, the Milky Way, on an aquatic centric planet called Earth.”

“Yes, the Earth. You are on Earth,” Jake said. “How...how, how do you speak English?” Jake was still trembling and thinking of sprinting for his life again.

“Our Naronian forefathers mapped these systems many years ago. All sentient species in The Nestomir have evolved over thousands of years to interpret language and dialects based on a wave signal all life forms give off, called the Utma. That's how I can speak your tongue, and many others,” the creature said.

“So you...you are…really an alien?” Jake blurted.

“Affirmative. From the glorious planet of Naronia,” the warrior thing responded.

“Naronia?”

“Yes. Though my ancestors are from a planet called Gobhar, which was destroyed thousands of years ago,” it said.

The creature stared back up at the night sky. “Stay here for a moment. Do not move.”

Jake watched as the thing shuffled towards the ship. _What have I done?_ It took a lap around the perimeter of the crash site. It was clear now that the flying thing was a spaceship. The front of it was the side facing away from him and was partially buried in the ground. The ship’s rear was sticking up in the air, facing Jake. He watched as the creature ran its hands across certain edges and panels of the otherworldly machine. It climbed up onto the top back of the machine, popped open a hatch, then slipped down it.

Jake stood there; his body was still trembling.

A short time later, the alien jumped back up the hatch carrying a gigantic metal chain, went to the underside of the ship, snapped it on somewhere, then carried the links back towards the center of the pit.

The creature stood for a moment holding the chain in its gloved hands, then it looked upward and closed its eyes, as if it were meditating, and its thick boots began to dig into the earth. It wrapped the chain around its upper body tightly, crouched forward, and its legs drove forward with all its might.

_VA NA MA NA VASOI._ Its biceps and shoulders swelled with alien blood. Then the warrior-being roared again.

Jake watched as the chain pulled onto somewhere near the underside of the buried nose of the ship. Soon the nose began to budge. There was a creaking noise and the dirt on the top half of the ship began to recess off.

“VA SHE NA FEDDO,” it roared.

Jake stood in amazement.

It pulled harder. The chain strapped against its chest. The ship’s front slid slowly out of the Earth, and giant mounds of rubble poured outward next to each side of the machine.

It continued to pull, yelling in a tongue Jake could not understand. The top half of the ship surfaced a few moments later; the direction of the chain’s tension caused the nose of the ship to rotate right as it came out of the rubble. Then, after a few loud _clangs_, and a series of deep grunts and shouts, the spacecraft was freed from the earth.

Jake blinked.

The sleek, black craft resembled an American stealth fighter jet. Two rectangular contraptions sat stacked on top of each other in the middle of each wing. In the center of each of these were circular cones that came together to form what appeared to be the interior of the ship's engines. The smoke coming from the back of the ship appeared to have mostly subsided, and on the top of the right wing Jake noticed a golden emblem similar to the one on the creature’s shoulder patch. _This is insane._

The alien dropped the chain. It tapped something on its bio-screen, and the ship suddenly rose a few feet above the ground, standing on some kind of protracted landing gear.

It turned towards Jake. “You have to come with me. Toss your communicator in the pit.”

Jake looked around, then back at the creature. “Come, come, with you? Are you joking? I’m only twelve. I have to go home. I never meant to come here. I promise you, I won’t remember this tomorrow. No one will ever know. This wasn’t real!” Jake took a step backward, preparing to run for it.

“I’m afraid it _is_ real, kid. I am sorry. We must leave now,” it uttered in its deep baritone. “We are not safe here. The enemy will be exploring all known systems, making sure there are no stragglers. You are coming with me. It is Spectator One Protocol.”

“Spectator _what_?” Jake said.

“Spectator One. Any bystander who witnesses a critical war event must be cared for by the Forces until one of our colonels debriefs you on base,” the creature said. “I’ll help you up, let’s go!”

Jake stood there, paralyzed with his mouth hanging open.

“Do not make me come and get you. You must come with me. _Spectator One_ is a rule I must not disobey. There have been terrible tragedies in the past when it has been ignored. The enemy could be watching, and if they’ve seen you, or traced us, you are not safe. They will hunt you down. I cannot leave you here, but I promise to help get you home as fast as I can.”

_This thing wants me to come with it? This is insane. None of this can be real._ He paused for a moment. _The enemy? Hunt me down?_ He felt sick. _What if it’s telling the truth?_

Jake dropped his phone in the mud.

The creature’s veiny arms pulled him up. _What am I doing?_ Jake felt even dizzier now, standing elevated above the corn, in the black of night, on a spacecraft.

“Let’s go. I’ll explain more in the air,” the creature said. It darted for the open hatch and popped down the exposed ladder. Jake followed him up towards the hatch, and then down the ladder cautiously.

As he got to the last rung, he let himself drop the remaining two feet down to the floor of the ship. He watched the creature walk down a dimly lit hall. A few moments later the lights in the compartment brightened.

Jake felt a surge of perceptive change riddle through his brain as he looked at his new surroundings. The compartment Jake was in was similar to the inside of a high-end RV he had seen on travel TV shows. A kitchen area sat on one side of the room with cabinets, cupboards, a toaster-looking device, and sink all stacked next to each other. On the other side of the room was a couch, and next to it a refrigerator, and next to that a small cubby-like compartment that may have been a restroom. He examined the kitchen area more closely. He spotted a futuristic-looking machine. _Is that a coffee maker?_ It had different colored tubes running from out of it into the back of the wall.

“I try to keep her cozy. We never know how long we’ll be locked up in our fighters,” the creature shouted from down the small hallway.

_This creature lives in its ship?_

“Come up here. We have to lift off, now,” the creature added.

_I guess I am listening to this thing._ Jake walked down the small hall, passed an intermediary room with different glowing equipment, and entered the ship’s cockpit.

Jake’s eyes opened wide as different shades of glowing oranges, greens, and blues overwhelmed his field of vision. The warrior was standing in front of what must have been the pilot’s seat.

“Have a seat, and buckle up,” it said. It directed him to the leather seat next to him. “Put your bag in the side compartment over there.”

_I have a seat?_ Jake thought to himself.

The creature slung a charcoal robe with a square hood over its body, then sat down. It tapped a few buttons on the dashboard. As Jake stepped down the short flight of steps, he caught a glance of the creature’s golden axe hanging on one of the hooks on the left wall. _Guess he doesn't need it when he’s piloting._

He sat down in the cockpit chair and snapped in the aluminum buckle. He peered through the slanted cockpit glass and traced the sloping nose of the ship. _This thing must go fast._ There was a large glowing computer screen in front of the creature. It had a map flashing on it. There was another large monitor in the center of the cockpit dashboard, two others on the top, near the ceiling, on adjustable mounts. There was also a smaller screen with a keyboard directly in front of Jake, but it was off.

The creature swiped through a few screens on the computer display in front of him. A minute later, the monitor brought up a pulsating 3D diagram that looked like an architectural sketch of a torpedo.

“I knew it,” the creature said. “The communications receiver is busted. That is why I am not getting anything back from base. Galactic mercy,” it grumbled. “We must get into the air, then sort this out.”

_What the heck is a communications receiver?_ Jake thought.

The creature looked at him and uttered, “Hold tight.”

It pulled down gently on the button-covered joystick, then flicked three small levers on the front left of the cockpit dashboard. There was a powerful low frequency roar as the ship engines fired to life.

“Please, let me out. I want nothing to do with this. I’ll never look back. Forget the protocol. I’ll probably wake up tomorrow and believe fully this was a dream. Two days from now I won’t remember it happened!” Jake pleaded, feeling queasy.

“I cannot take you back. Not yet. It is a strict Solar Forces protocol, even out-of-galaxy.”

“Let me go! I beg you!” Jake shrieked.

The creature took its hand off the joystick. “You are not being kidnapped, kid. My duty now is to keep you safe.”

Jake started to tremble again. He felt like he was going to throw up.

The creature’s eyebrows rose as he studied a smaller purple screen on the central console. “We have no choice but to fix our Communications Receiver. The radium core is corrupted.”

The creature tapped a strange-looking icon on the monitor in front him. A 2D map appeared with a topographical map of the continental United States.

“This is in fact a settled system...I _believe_ it’s the Guido van Rossum system. But there are no radium depots listed in the Enlightened Registry. We could explore further, but I have no contacts that I trust here.” The creature paused for a few moments. “There is also no guarantee that I would find the right type of garage which contains the parts we require—256-bit receivers are not commonly found within civilian populations.”

The screen let out a chime. The creature glanced back at the glowing monitor.

40.7608° N, 111.8910° W | 1,437 Miles | Waypoint Guidance Available

“It seems Lithium Radar has discovered a candidate for us to get the radium needed to fix our receiver. Let’s see here.” The warrior creature scrolled through the map. “Yes, it has identified a laboratory just outside of Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, North America, as a 99.997% positive source of radium.”

The creature clicked on a blinking indicator on the screen. He looked at a set of characters too hard to see from where Jake was sitting. “It appears to be a private laboratory facility..._Chiral Laboratories_...it does contract work for your government...won’t be able to get more information until we’re on the ground in the vicinity of their wired network.”

“You want to take us to Utah? Are you serious?” Jake asked.

“It won’t take long,” the creature said. “Hopefully, it will not be too difficult of an operation.”

“An _operation_? What do you mean _operation_?” Jake said in a high-pitched voice.

“We need the radium to fix our communications receiver. We have no choice, kid. That’s how we get you home. It’s best not to think about it until we’re on the ground,” it said. The creature clicked a few pop-ups on the monitor directly in front of him. “Should be a quick in and out. Ship, prepare for quasi-runway take off!”

The engines roared, consuming a fuel source Jake didn’t understand. His belt automatically tightened to the point it was uncomfortable.

The creature hit a few more buttons on the dashboard, then closed its eyes, holding its hands to its face like it was praying. “Give me the strength to get through this journey, and to bring this Earthling back safely. _Lena Akma Vena_.” It pushed down on the joystick and the ship jolted forward.

Jake watched as the stalks crumpled beneath the black nose of the ship. He closed his eyes. _Is this thing really taking off?_

As the creature pushed down harder on the throttle, Jake was pushed back against his seat. _I can’t breathe._

They accelerated faster now.

“Hold on, friend!” the creature uttered.

The ship blazed across the corn filled terrain.

The creature pulled the joystick in the reverse. The nose picked upward gently. Jake felt his weight shift. _Woah._ To his right the ground was already departing. They were airborne.

The G-force increased as the ship jetted into the sky. Cedar Oaks receded quickly, and before he knew it, the first clouds were grazing across the eccentrically curved nose of the ship.

_Is this a dream?_ Jake thought. _If this is a stress-induced hallucination, then when is it going to end? If it's not, then how is this possible? What will Jimmy and Mom think when I'm not home in the morning?_

Jake felt nausea come and go over the next minute and a half as they ascended.

_BEEP-BEEP._ A sound came from somewhere on the top of the cockpit.

“We are at cruising altitude,” said the creature. It brought the throttle back into its center position, then clicked two large purple buttons in succession on the dashboard.

Jake’s nausea subsided slightly as the ship leveled off. He could see the faint glow of lights from the land below.

“Autopilot, proceed on waypoint guidance,” the creature said to the monitor.

“Autopilot confirmed. Cruising to destination via set waypoint guidance,” a female voice from the cockpit responded.

_The ship computer speaks?_

The creature unbuckled its seatbelt, stood up, stretched its neck, then stuck out its hand. “The name’s Dendro. Dendro Salāhakāra, Solar Forces, Special Operations Captain, Tier II, Republic of Naronia, Star System A, The Nestomir.”

Jake stuck out his hand. “Jake Addison”.

“Jake Addison, the Earthling who discovered me in the dark of night,” Dendro said.

“I...I smelled something. I was curious. I should never have walked through the alley,” Jake said.

The Dendro creature sat back down. “You probably shouldn’t have walked down that alley because now you’re tied up in my mess. I’m sorry, I really am.” The robed creature glared out the cockpit window. “Curiosity can take us to all sorts of places.”

Jake glanced out the cockpit window. A dim front ship light had turned on. He could see endless layers of clouds stretching across the dark sky. He looked back at the creature. “Is this real? Are _you_ real? A spaceship? An alien warrior? I just want to get back to my family. I swear, I will pretend this was a dream. No one will ever know. I promise you on my mother’s and brother’s life.”

“I am sorry. There is nothing I can do until I can communicate back to base. Let’s fix this receiver and you’ll be home soon,” Dendro said.

Jake squeezed his head back against the headrest as they cut through the ozone. The blue light beams coming from the nose of the ship projected through the damp night sky. A new reality began to set in. And Jake had no control.

“So you are some kind of warrior, a captain from your galaxy?” Jake asked.

“Affirmative. I am a soldier, a captain, in the Solar Forces Special Operations unit,” Dendro said. “The Solar Forces is the core military power serving the Republic of Naronia. Naronia is the capital of my galaxy. You are sitting in a special operations military fighter right now.”

“That’s impressive...I guess.” He paused for a moment, still struggling to comprehend he was talking to something, someone, not from Earth. “And you have no understanding how you ended up half-submerged inside of a crater in a cornfield in Grapefield, Wisconsin? Grapefield, one of the _least_ happening places on Earth?”

“I have not the faintest indication. The last thing I remember was exiting our Solar Forces Destroyer in this ship. I must have been knocked out the instant the gate opened by a nearby plasma explosion. And it must have been a big one.” Dendro took off his gloves. His hands were human like, except for the nails. They were long, and sharp. He ran his fingers through his dark locks, then tightened his man-bun.

“You were ambushed, you said?” Jake asked.

“Affirmative, we were ambushed in the Larhadian Belt, an asteroid arrangement within Naronian space jurisdiction–the enemy lured us in. We brought a tremendous force with us, much larger than I recommended, but we were still not prepared for what happened next. The last thing I remember was diving into the ship after the emergency sirens fired off, and I was in open space, and the firefight had already begun. Then I was out cold,” Dendro said. “The Venthum are cunning.”

“The Venthum?” Jake asked.

“Our ancient enemy. An enemy we’ve fought for over ten millennia. Many thousands of years ago we were great allies. Millions of lives have been lost in the Dark Wars that occurred between our civilizations, both of which were before my time,” Dendro said. “Our culture carries a great hatred for our great enemy. And now, nearly five thousand years since the end of the second Dark War, another great war is coming.”

Dendro swiveled his neck in a stretching motion, exposing additional tattoos on his skin.

“You think they are searching for us?” Jake asked, his stomach tightening.

“Venthum Space Legion search and destroy battalions scout populated systems after successful ambushes,” Dendro said. “The less of the enemy that returns home, the better.”

“Can they track us?” Jake asked.

“I do not think so. At least not with the technology we know of. But they have advanced their stealth-ship signature recognition, which means we need to be careful and stay out of sight as much as possible. At thirty thousand feet, we are the safest.”

“So, you’re not even sure what they can do?” Jake asked, despondently.

“With the Venthum, nothing is ever certain. The enemy hides their assets well. It is too great a risk to leave you until we know we have not been tracked. That’s why we must communicate back to base, regroup, and disperse as fast as we can.”

Jake inhaled deeply. _How can we be safe? Will we ever come down from the sky?_

They cruised along for a few more minutes. Jake tried to calm his heart down and put things into perspective.

“How far away is it? Your galaxy?” Jake asked.

“You ask a lot of questions.” The creature put his gloves back on and adjusted the throttle slightly. “The Nestomir is approximately three and a half million light years from your home planet Earth.”

“How could you possibly get here?” Jake asked, stunned.

“We are ahead of you in terms of technological evolution. We became interstellar five thousand years ago with the discovery of quantum space,” Dendro said. “But my ship does not have a booster installed, so I cannot travel through the stars alone, at least, not for now.”

Jake scratched his chin. _Quantum space?_ He pondered for a moment about the implications of traveling through the stars. Then he thought of Dendro’s planet. “What is your world like?”

“Well, Earthing, my home planet of Naronia is a complicated world, and I would have trouble knowing where to start if I were to describe it to you. It is a busy planet, with a variety of races living amongst one another. The planet Naronia is the capital of The Nestomir Galaxy, to those societies under jurisdiction of the Naronian Republic.”

“The Naronian Republic?”

“Yes. The Naronian Republic was founded three thousand years ago, after The Mentosi brought back political stability to Naronia. It has brought extraordinary advances to our society in education, safety, infrastructure, medicine–almost all aspects of life.” Dendro stretched his neck in both directions. “However, many class and race issues that have plagued our society for generations still exist today.”

“Class and race issues?” Jake asked. _Just like Earth_. “And who are The Mentosi?”

“The Mentosi are an ancient Naronian race. They are the only species of high-intelligence native to Naronia. The ruling Mentosi family, The Affagi, sit at the forefront of Naronian politics. The Affagi have been the primary leaders in all of the Naronian government for over twenty-five hundred years,” Dendro said.

“And there are really class issues where you come from?” Jake asked.

Dendro massaged his left arm. “The class and race issues are complicated. The Mentosi, as well as the first sentient races to immigrate to Naronia, are what our culture refers to as _Tier I_ races. These races get the first pick at education, high-paying jobs, and the best that life has to offer in the galaxy. Tier II races, which consist of races that arrived to Naronia later in our history, have limited job options, and have disadvantages in many areas of society, including the military.”

“That is sad. You would think you would have corrected those issues, especially if you’ve figured out interstellar travel,” Jake said.

Dendro's eyes widened momentarily, then his face went stoic again. “It _is_ hard, but I love my planet. She will heal over time.” He massaged the silver orb on his chest. Then he waved his pointer around the cockpit. “This baby, my ship, they won’t even give me a booster, and I’m a Special Ops captain. The Gobhrahim immigrated into Naronia long after the Tier I races.”

“So you are...,” Jake began.

“The Gobhrahim, my people, are classified as a Tier II Race. We immigrated a relatively short time ago, in the galactic time frame, after my ancestral planet, Gobhar, was destroyed in the First Dark War.”

_His ancestral planet was destroyed?_ “Is there anything you can do about these societal issues?” Jake asked.

“I can fight. I can learn. And I can make a difference, where nature lets me.” Dendro pushed down on the throttle slightly.

They sat in silence for a few moments.

“But you said these Mentosi rule. How can these Mentosi _rule_ if it is a republic? Jake asked.

Dendro raised his thick eyebrows. “You are an inquisitive one, kid. What you’re asking is an important question. And it’s not one for me to analyze out loud as a member of our armed forces. I will say that there is a fine line between what is a democracy and what is not. Our Solar Senate and the Naronian Counsel work together as an effective balance of powers, yet the tentacles of Affagi influence are wrapped around nearly all elements of Naronian society; it’s not hard to see that they possess a form of authoritative rule. However, even as a Tier II race, I’ve always seen The Affagi as a benevolent entity, even with their antiquated class ideologies. At the end of the day, they have been the single most important driver of some of the greatest things to happen to our culture, like our greatly enlightened education system, the arts, and the growth of our military. What we need to do is to figure out a way to evolve for the better, not eliminate the things they’ve achieved.

Dendro shifted a red lever on the dashboard to its leftmost position. “Enough politics. C’mon, let’s stretch these legs and have a quick tour of the ship.”

The robed warrior pushed himself up, walked up the two cockpit stairs, and went down the short hallway. Jake followed, taking a quick peep at the golden axe resting on the wall.

They stopped in the small space in between the living area of the ship and the cockpit. “This is the _caravine_,” Dendro said. “This is where I’d be able to map out communication logistics across the galaxy and beyond. But our booster’s broken.”

Jake turned towards the mix of wires and lights on the ceiling high black panel in front of him. _Those are a lot of switches._

He followed Dendro into the midsection of the ship. The captain pointed at the stove and sink area. “Here is where I cook, make tea, and anything else I need to survive on a long interstellar journey.” He pointed to the machine next to the couch across from them. “Long storage refrigeration.” He pointed back to the intriguing looking machine on the left side of the sink. “And here we have my Kahve maker, my stove, griddle, toaster, and twenty-four seven water filtration.”

The creature grabbed a thin glass column from inside of a small brown kettle on the counter. “Here, have a sip. It’ll warm your spirit.”

The liquid in the glass was a solid amber color. Steam was funneling out the top. “What is this stuff?”

“Jasmine tea. Don’t worry. It’s all natural.”

Jake put his mouth on the column and dipped his tongue inside. Hints of caramel, mint, and chai lightly massaged his tongue.

Jake dribbled a bit the liquid on his chin and wiped it off. “It’s good. It’s kind of sweet, but very smooth. I like it.”

The warrior’s chiseled face flashed a grin.

Jake turned towards the peculiar-looking machine Dendro had pointed to a moment ago. The metal base had three glass beakers sitting on top of it. The largest beaker bubbled with purple liquid, and the other two bubbled with a dark brown liquid. Multiple tubes ran out of the back of the contraption. One of the tubes was solid gold.

“What is Kahve?” Jake asked.

“It’s like what you would call _coffee_. It’s a bit smoother, and a lot stronger,” Dendro said.

“What is the gold tube?” Jake asked curiously.

Dendro giggled under his breath and pulled up the small plated window above the Kahve machine. “Here, Earthling. Have a look.”

“Whoa.” Jake stared at the curved right wing. “That’s so cool.” Just beyond it, a fifteen-foot stream of blue flame poured out from the rectangular engine blocks.

“How fast can this thing really go?” Jake asked.

“It’s hard to say. A lot of variables: wind, fuel grade, atmospheric density, atmospheric oxygen-to-nitrogen ratios. In the current atmospheric state, I could probably push her to Mach 7. That’s seven times the speed of sound in Earth air. But I have to treat her right.” Dendro tapped the counter gently with his knuckles. “Only ever push her to the limit when I really have to. She’s been with me through thick and thin–she’s an authentic Sentauri Beacon I, the smoothest stealth fighter I’ve ever flown. Triple hydrogen blast furnace engines. Full cavity deflection shields. Can’t find these in production anymore, they were replaced by the new Star Beacon VII’s only five years back. The Forces said it was more economic,” Dendro said. The blue light from the engines grazed across his face.

He pointed at the door next to the fridge. “Here’s the bathroom. Lock broke, not sure how, but don’t worry, I won’t peek.” He chuckled and walked to the back of the compartment and put his right eye against a wall sensor. The sliding doors skidded open.

Jake followed him into the room. This room felt like a bedroom in a futuristic military barracks. The walls were plated with cold metal panels. The left corner of the space had a narrow bed. It was covered by a felt blanket and a small book. A white pillow sat on top. _I guess we are not so different._ A small window sat on the back wall which looked out into the night. _That’s cool._ To the right, piles of books sat on the metal shelves. _This guy reads?_

Jake examined the titles. _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius, _The Soul of a New Machine_ by Tracy Kidder, _The Learning Doctrines_ by Zinthus Fomega, _The Philosophical Tenets of the Ld’Shab_ by Anonymous, _Ld’Shab Prayers_ by Franz Ameinu, the list went on. _There’s more to this creature than meets the eye._ He thought. _He reads science? And he prays?_

“This is my dormitory,” Dendro said.

Jake glanced around the room again. “Looks like a decent place to get some rest,” he said. It almost felt cozy, in its own alien way.

Dendro tightened the belt of his robe. “I guess that depends if there’s anyone on my tail.” He grinned. “C’mon, let’s head back to the pit. We still have two hours before we touch down at our next destination. You should get some rest on the couch. We have a long night ahead. Don’t worry, it’s clean. It has a Titanium Dioxide purification layer in the linen,” he said.

Jake looked at the couch. It looked comfortable enough. “I guess a nap wouldn’t hurt,” Jake replied.

“Good. I will be in the pit if you need me,” the creature said.

The leather-like material that made up the sofa was oddly smooth, almost too smooth for comfort. He was too exhausted to think about it further. Jake rolled over onto his back and turned towards the kitchen window. _It must be getting late by now. My mom will be worried._ His stomach began to ache. He wished Nassir was with him—he would help him think of a way out of this. He looked out the window at the blue phosphorescence. An otherworldly machination propelled them through the air. Coffee like machines with mysterious golden tubes. None of this made sense. He pulled his hoodie over his head and eventually fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
