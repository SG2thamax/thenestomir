## PROLOGUE

#### TUESDAY NIGHT

The pilot of the _FS Gravis_ checked his quantum starmap. He was closing in on his destination—and now it was time to phase back into real-space. He initiated the interstellar drive's five second phase-down sequence by hitting the glowing blue button in front of him and waving his hand over the ship's engine control screen. A few seconds later, the familiar sounds of warped space opening itself up, and then stitching itself back together, echoed through the freighter. After a loud clang and a blinding flash of light, the ship sat in the target system as if it had been there all along.

Radar confirmed that he was positioned inside of a uni-starred solar system with nine planets. _We’ve arrived_, he thought. A feeling of satisfaction and relief surged through him as he scanned the vast expanse of this new galaxy. He tapped his leather seat handle. _Thank you for getting me—us—here. I can’t believe I purchased you for one hundred thousand Naronian Kroners! What a steal._

The yellow star in the center of this system caught the pilot’s attention. It looked similar to Stella, the larger of the two stars that illuminated his home planet. _I guess we all come from similar beginnings_, he thought. But the greenish blue planet, his target, sitting twenty thousand kilometers in front of him was unlike any planet he’d ever seen. Seven continents immersed in clear blue oceans. A white atmosphere as crisp as his grandmother’s iced vanilla wafer pudding. _I wonder what it’s like down there_. He hit two silver switches on his dashboard to prepare for planetary descent.

The radar system began to clatter. The pilot peered at his vessel-detection readout. INCOMING THREAT: SHIP REAR. As he shifted to the back view of his ship, he prayed the alert was triggered by a small asteroid or comet coming too close.

But to his dismay, it was not.

It was a silver Vagabond II Stealth Fighter, with vacuum torpedoes armed and ready to fire. It was one kilometer behind him and approaching fast.
